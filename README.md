Hello! That's my own small "framework".
I want to use only those technologies that make me excited about them.
That means that list of those technologies could change over time.

Actual list of my favorites:

* Technologies for application:
  * [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) is best solution to write
    truly flexible backend API.
  * [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com) is very useful database for data that are weaves
    like a spider web. At first, its query language seems strange, but after
    a while comes the realization of all its power.
  * [Express](http://expressjs.com) is popular library to write HTTP servers
    without pain. All my HTTP servers are pretty simple so express fits for all
    my needs.
* Technologies for application development:
  * [Babel](http://babeljs.io). I love all the new features of ECMAScript!
    And babel allows me to use those features right now.
  * [ESLint](http://eslint.org) keeps my internal perfectionist in comfort.
  * [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) is very powerful tool that helps me
    build first-grade releases. Finest tool at current time but not simplest.
  * [Forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever) is used to restart backend
    server when code is changed by developer. Hot reload everywhere!

I believe that best Developer Experience leads us to best User Experience.
